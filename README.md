# TranquiScan - Wildlife Sedation with Image Precision
The TranquiScan project is designed to mitigate human-wildlife conflict by offering a
sophisticated wildlife management system. TranquiScan uses high-end technologies to
detect animals in real-time. Different modules are used by the project to identify animals, watch them manually, release darts for sedation, and maintain a logged database of
ungulates. This will ensure a productive and efficient system to manage wildlife.
It works on Raspberry Pi enabling Edge Computing, and enables real-time processing
in outdoor environments which resolves the power consumption and connectivity issues.
With the help of a high-resolution camera and an efficient processing system, TranquiScanâ€™s sentry mechanism is able to detect and locate ungulates quickly.
Compared to previous works, TranquiScan has the feature of being versatile and can
be adapted in different situations. This project is beneficial for private and federal security agencies. The TranquiScan system is a new way to address safety. It protects
the environment and contributes to broader environmental goals making it pioneering in
conservational efforts.

This project is a combined effort done by Kevin Suresh, Joel Johnson, George Thomas and Henick Thadevous Peter of class CSBeta Batch 2024, Rajagiri School of Engineering and Technology, Kakkanad.
